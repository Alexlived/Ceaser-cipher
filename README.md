# Ceaser-cipher
Just a ceasercipher i made,was kinda hard,not really tho just had a hard time at first with the encrypt function in the giant line of code that finds the index of letter in a 
list(upper and lower) and then adds the shift key to the index and then finds what is in the new,shifted index in the same list(upper or lower)
